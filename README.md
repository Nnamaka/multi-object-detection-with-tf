 For this project, I will be detecting hand gestures for 'livelong', 'thumbsup', 'thumbsdown', 'thankyou'.
 Prior to the beginning this project, I had collected and preannoted my image dataset. 
 I used the <a href="https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg">labellimg</a> tool to label and annotate my images.
 My images were saved in the pascalVOC format which is an acceptable format for object detection when using the TFOD API.
